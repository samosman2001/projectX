📌 Overview

ProjectX is a demo web application I built while practicing PHP and MySQL.
It includes user authentication, session handling, and database integration.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to work with backend logic, manage data, and structure a small PHP application that can integrate with both a dashboard and a Capacitor mobile app.

🚀 Features

User registration & login with PHP sessions

MySQL database integration (CRUD operations)

Basic form validation

Simple dashboard interface

Capacitor mobile app integration with backend

Organized folder structure for backend/frontend

⚙️ Tech Stack

Backend: PHP (vanilla)

Database: MySQL

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Mobile: Capacitor (Android/iOS wrapper)
